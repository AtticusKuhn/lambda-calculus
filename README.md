# lambda
I have written a simple interpreter for the lambda calculus in Haskell. I have done
this to learn about the Church Encodings and the Scott Encodings. I think it's
pretty neat that you can do all of programming from only functions and with no
data-structures. 

I hope to write a simple meta-interpter for the lambda calculus inside the lambda
calculus, but that is in the works
